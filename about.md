These pages highlight some of my student's work. I am a software developer passing on my trade. It was also my father's trade. And my brother's. As well as developer I have also held the role of product manager and sales engineer. I believe that interface is king. I also believe strongly in pattern language, systematic problem solving and test driven development. Actually anything by [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) is pretty good in my opinion. Facebook is really strong from a [development operations](https://code.facebook.com/posts/270314900139291/rapid-release-at-massive-scale/) perspective if not an ethical perspective.

### Idea 1 that I can't get out of my head

I worked for 18 years in a multinational corporation. Money that we left on the table was for data based decision making. Particularly one of our customers wanted to do forecasting for service operations. It wasn't till during my MBA that I realized what they were looking for was a way to track finishing times and staffing levels and do linear regression to get more effective at both. I have data that says there are more companies that want to get better at using data to guide decision making.

As well as companies needing data for decision making software development is at an inflection point. This inflection point is a big opportunity for people that just want to get a software job as quickly as possible. I want to use this inflection point to re-segment software training. Meet Jane. Jane has a master's in math from a local university. Jane is still struggling to find work. Her dream job is to work for a math software company in Waterloo. Jane's dream does come true and she leaves a diploma program early after 2 years. I have found data that indicates that there are enough more like Jane. People that just want to work and are making do with longer degree and diploma programs. 

### Idea 2 that I can't get out of my head

All my life I have been eating oats everyday. Oats that are good for me but less good for the earth. Sadly even less good for the farmer. Back of the [envelope math](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/busdev/facts/pub60.pdf) says conventional production of oats costs 199 to produce. Oats could sell for as little as ~204/acre. There are some other benefits to growing oats as part of a more lucrative cash crop rotation. Clearly if the cost of production could be reduced for cash crops even oats could be more appealing to farmers. Conventional oat growing uses 14L of fuel per acre representing 7 % of the cost. If green manure is used instead of conventional fertilizer fuel usage increases by ~ 10L /per acre becoming 14% of the total cost.  If fuel could be recycled from CO2 on the farm the combination of green manure and CO2 recycling could drop the cost of producing oats to 158/acre. The profit on oats would be almost 10x from $5 to $46 /acre.

Recently my son turned me on to [this research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/admt.201600092) by Stuart Licht and others recycling CO2 to CH4 at high efficiency at 600C. New Holland has a concept [tractor that runs on CNG](http://agriculture1.newholland.com/apac/en-nz/about-us/whats-up/news-events/2017/new-holland-unveils-methane-powered-concept) that could consume the CH4 compressed by [one of these](https://www.bauercomp.com/en/products-solutions/cng). 600C and ~4 watts of electric power would come [from a windmill](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148115003079#!) using an [electromagnetic retarder](https://www.telmausa.com/). Recycling CO2 to produce oats more efficiently is an idea that would have benefit today. The pieces are coming together.

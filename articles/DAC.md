 This is the story of my own personal analog to digital conversion and the lessons I learned from it. I am writing primarily for an old friend and a student that asked me about this. I am a geeky guy. When I was a kid I loved electronics. I built guitar effects in my bedroom. I also had various degrees of home brew stereos. When I got home from school I used to always put on "Love Rollercoaster" by the Ohio Players. When I got wheels (an otherwise regrettable Dodge Omni) I had a partly homebrew sound system in that as well. My sweetheart and I used to drive from Barrie to Waterloo for night school courses. On the way we talked and listened to Queen, The Steve Miller Band and Bonnie Tyler. 

"Fast forward to a few years later." We started a family and things started to get real. My then 3 year old and his friend wrecked my turntable. My records disappeared. My kids got older and we got into videos as well as their own musical tastes. Even basic sound systems in cars got way better and we went on lots of road trips for soccer hockey to visit Granny in Calgary and to summer camp and the Lake St. Joe club where our kids had summer jobs. We have a lot of media. Probably just as well we lost our cassette and VHS tapes during that time when it was all hands on deck just getting our kids where they needed to be. Now our kids aren't and we have grand-kids my sweetheart and I are bringing back media to our lives.

I can remember my own parents buying a stereo when we all moved out. In true twenty something naivety I referred to them as latent yuppies. Sorry Mom and Dad. A few years later we visited our eldest Tim and his wife Fleur in Australia and they had just bought themselves a record player. It was really fun going through op shops as he called them and finding records. When my sweetheart and I moved out of our family house so that our daughter could use it for her family it was our turn to get a record player. I went to a stereo store in Brantford where I was teaching at Laurier and bought a record player. He tried to sell me a tuner and speakers as well, but I am glad that I resisted. More about that later but this is why I am writing.

The first incarnation of my media system was built on the [~$150 record player](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-PS-LX300USB-Stereo-Turntable-Black/dp/B0015HOFZI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1530285751&sr=8-2&keywords=sony+turntable+usb) which had a built in preamp like Tim's. I got [~$150 Bose bookshelf computer speakers](https://www.amazon.ca/Bose-Companion-Multimedia-Speakers-3-5mm/dp/B00CD1PTF0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530285891&sr=1-1&keywords=bose+computer+speakers) with 2 analog 3.5mm stereo inputs and played the record player through a [3.5 mm male to rca female x 2 cable](https://www.amazon.ca/UGREEN-Splitter-Smartphones-Tablets-Theater/dp/B00B2HP1MW/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530285962&sr=1-9&keywords=rca+to+3.5+mm) into one of those inputs. I bought a  [~$150 hdmi switch](https://www.amazon.ca/iArk-TOSLINK-Extractor-Splitter-Supports/dp/B075WVVY6B/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530285238&sr=8-1&keywords=iArk+3x1+V1.4+HDMI+Switch+with+TOSLINK+Optical+SPDIF+%26+RCA+L%2FR+Audio+Out%2C+3+Port+HDMI+Audio+Extractor+Splitter+with+Remote%2C+Supports+ARC%2C+4kx2k%4030hz%2C+Full+3D%2C+1080P) with a digital to analog converter (DAC) to plug in with a [3.5mm to male rca cable](https://www.amazon.ca/AmazonBasics-3-5mm-2-Male-Adapter-Cable/dp/B01D5H8JW0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1530407189&sr=8-3&keywords=3.5mm+to+rca+male) to the other analog input  of the Bose powered speakers. I got an [HDMI conversion cable](https://www.staples.ca/lightning+to+hdmi/directory_lightning+to+hdmi_20051_1_20001) for an IPOD that I already had and a ~$150 [bluray player](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-BDPS6500-Upscaling-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B00X6AGWRQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530409817&sr=1-1&keywords=BDPS6500) and I was set. I think that I also needed a male to male [standard hdmi cable](https://www.amazon.ca/Your-Cable-Store-HDMI-1-4/dp/B01H46DAE0/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530286462&sr=1-6&keywords=hdmi+1+foot+cable) as the switch didn't come with one. I used Itunes, the CBC apps, Radio Player Canada and TuneIn Radio for digital media from my ipod, found records and CDs everywhere. and was very happy with the results. To organize the media we got a [book shelf from Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/40302289/). We got a nice [Palliser couch](http://www.davisfurniturewa.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sleeper-sofa/palliser-77500-22-corissa-sofabed-60.php) with a hide a bed to watch from.

Things got real again, we moved and we "cut the cable." No cable TV and no landline. Only internet. When we "cut the cable" I got our original home phone number ported to [VOIP.ms](https://voip.ms). For a while for our home phone we used the Zoiper app on our Android phones. There was a real quality problem that my Mom particularly noticed. A pretty technical solution but we used the AIX protocol over UDP with Zoiper. UDP is meant to be efficient. Underlying the internet are frames, a lot like frames in an animation or movie. If you move from frame to frame fast enough you can see a moving picture. The internet can transfer frames so quickly that we can get many movies at the same time on it. Our devices just ignore frames that are meant for someone else. UDP deals with damaged or missing frames by discarding them. Better never then late. It turned out that missing frames was as unacceptable for telephone use as it would be for streaming audio. We noticed it mostly when speaking with our mothers. Glitches due to missing frames would frustrate them. We were also worried about someone needing to find their phone before potentially calling 911. To solve the quality problem and the safety issue we went with a [voip phone](https://www.amazon.ca/Grandstream-GS-GXP1610-Small-Business-Device/dp/B00U0Z8DFE/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530287703&sr=1-6&keywords=grandstream+voip+phone). Now Grandma (and telephone solicitors) come in crystal clear. Supporting the clear sound is the TCP error correcting protocol over SIP on the Grandstream phone. It re-transmits damaged frames and only presents them when the transport is complete. 

My youngest son, Joel, and I nearly dropped the couch moving it. Sadly the bookshelf didn't survive the move. After buying a house, moving again and [wall mounting](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00L1FMBQ4/ref=pe_3034960_236394800_TE_dp_2) system 1 in our bedroom I was ready for system 2. To prepare for system 2 we replaced the HDMI switch in system 1 with an [hdmi audio splitter](https://www.amazon.ca/UGREEN-Extractor-Splitter-Converter-Chromecast/dp/B01LKOTRNA/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530407606&sr=1-4&keywords=ugreen+hdmi+audio+extractor) and a female to female [hdmi coupler](https://www.amazon.ca/VCE-Adapter-Coupler-Resolution-Connector/dp/B01N5Y7E2O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1530644833&sr=8-3&keywords=female+to+female+hdmi+adapter). The [bluray player](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-BDPS6500-Upscaling-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B00X6AGWRQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530409817&sr=1-1&keywords=BDPS6500) with a [Chromecast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015). The first big test of the setup was watching NASA's coverage of the eclipse last summer with my Grandson. We subscribed to ~$10 Netflix, ~$10 Crave TV and ~$10 CBC TV premium and find that we have all of the content that we need. We probably miss network TV (other than CBC) a little, but we don't miss the expense. CBC had good olympics coverage and hockey games. I take my grandson to Rangers games, go to concerts and buy media for much less than we were paying for cable.

With the original setup in the bedroom, I had the [HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.ca/iArk-TOSLINK-Extractor-Splitter-Supports/dp/B075WVVY6B/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530285238&sr=8-1&keywords=iArk+3x1+V1.4+HDMI+Switch+with+TOSLINK+Optical+SPDIF+%26+RCA+L%2FR+Audio+Out%2C+3+Port+HDMI+Audio+Extractor+Splitter+with+Remote%2C+Supports+ARC%2C+4kx2k%4030hz%2C+Full+3D%2C+1080P), [record player](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-PS-LX300USB-Stereo-Turntable-Black/dp/B0015HOFZI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1530285751&sr=8-2&keywords=sony+turntable+usb) and [bluray player](https://www.amazon.ca/Sony-BDPS6500-Upscaling-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B00X6AGWRQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530409817&sr=1-1&keywords=BDPS6500) to build a new system around. My original idea was to put a floating shelf over our piano and wall mount a wide angle [Samsung monitor](https://www.amazon.ca/Samsung-S22F352FHN-Bezel-Monitor-1920x1080/dp/B01F9UBTMI/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1530408711&sr=8-10&keywords=samsung+vesa+monitor) for video. We ran out of time to do that so I ended up with a [bread rack arrangement](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Seville-Classics-24-in-W-x-72-in-H-x-18-in-D-5-Shelf-Steel-Wire-Wheeled-Shelving-Unit-in-UltraZinc-SHE18240ZB/206965860). Unlike the picture mine is black. When we moved I got "piano movers." The quotes are necessary because they didn't actually move my piano where I wanted it as they said they couldn't. I got a second opinion from the piano tuner and he said that the [people that originally moved our piano](https://www.attunedmoving.com/) were still the best bet. He said that he had seen them get a baby grand piano through an entrance the size of our house. My Mom repaired some veneer on the piano and my plan is to build the hanging shelves and get them to do it.

I was glad that I didn't buy the tuner in Brantford. TuneIn radio and RadioPlayer Canada are so much better than a tuner. There is a jazz station I like in Winston Salem, a Blues station that I like from Normal Illinois and an alternative station I like from Seattle. I did however make some mistakes. I reasoned that integrated amplifiers hit their peak in the 80s so I got my Sansui amp from Kijiji. It sounds fine but it doesn't have digital sound inputs. Next time I will buy a [new integrated amplifier](https://www.amazon.ca/Onkyo-A-9010-Integrated-Stereo-Amplifier/dp/B00SY20TE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530406546&sr=8-1&keywords=Onkyo+A-9010+Integrated+Stereo+Amplifier) with a built in digital to audio converter (DAC). It will require a [toslink cable](https://www.amazon.ca/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink/dp/B00L3KO5WK/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1530646964&sr=1-5&keywords=toslink+cable) to go between the amplifier and the [HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.ca/iArk-TOSLINK-Extractor-Splitter-Supports/dp/B075WVVY6B/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530285238&sr=8-1&keywords=iArk+3x1+V1.4+HDMI+Switch+with+TOSLINK+Optical+SPDIF+%26+RCA+L%2FR+Audio+Out%2C+3+Port+HDMI+Audio+Extractor+Splitter+with+Remote%2C+Supports+ARC%2C+4kx2k%4030hz%2C+Full+3D%2C+1080P). I have built several speaker sets over the years including the awesome set I did in the otherwise regrettable Dodge Omni. This time I wanted bookshelf speakers as we don't have a lot of room. I settled on [Paradigm's](https://www.paradigm.com/products-archived/type=bookshelf/model=atom-monitor/page=overview) thinking that they were Canadian made still. Now my particular version are Canadian designed only. The Paradigms sound great but my buddy has new Angstrom loudspeakers that I like a lot better.

My childhood friend and I have been going camping with our kids every father's day weekend for the last 20 years. When we were kids we used to listen to cassettes on car stereos when we were camping. My buddies kids are tradespersons and they have those rechargeable battery radios. A poor substitute for listening to albums. The last 2 years I have brought a [Bose Bluetooth speaker](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01HETFQKS/ref=pe_3034960_233709270_TE_item) camping. Instead of those cassettes I have archival copies of all my media except for the records on my phone. I used Exact Audio Copy to rip my CDs to flac files. My plan is to also rip the records to flac with the usb cable that came with the record player and Audacity. There is a flac splitter that will take the record rip and split it into songs with a track list from freedb. I use Bubble Upnp on my phone to play the music on Bluetooth and through my Chromecast in the bedroom or living room. An extra benefit of the Bluetooth speaker is that when Dianne and I go away we have tunes too. Our eldest Tim from Australia organized a meeting in Boston in the winter. I found a lot of the media we listened to on the road trips of his childhood. The 3 of us listened to it together and talked and drank in an AirBnb when we met him for the weekend.

I went to the stereo store in Brantford not knowing what I wanted. He correctly steered me away from an AV amplifier. We like music at least as much as movies and the integrated amplifier and speakers sound great with the record player, a [bluetooth dongle](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B009OBCAW2/ref=pe_3034960_236394800_TE_dp_2) on aux and the digital inputs on tuner.

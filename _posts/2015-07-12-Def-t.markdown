Someone in my second career class had been a counsellor for many years at the Ernest C. Drury School for the Deaf in Milton. For their CAPSTONE they reconnected by making a website for the Def-t shop which was being launched at the same time. A number of students from the class worked on the site and the videos. Towards the end the students and I went down for a cup of tea.

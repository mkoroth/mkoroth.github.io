Particularly choose your own adventure games are a very engaging way to teach the selection programming concept. I got the idea from some students in my CP104 class and from speaking with Dr. Scott Nicholson, the Director of the Game Design and Development Program that the students were part of. There is quite an interest in text bots from students. They recognize their own reluctance to install more apps on their phones. A graduating business technology management student even combined sentiment analysis with his bot.

Students had 3 hours to put together a website with a subtheme and a shortcode plugin that connected to a slim api back end to insert data into the Wordpress Database. They all had to do the site on the topic of their favourite food. The idea was that they were selling their favourite food in a basket delivery service. Customers could customize the basket by adding items to it. As well as the subtheme the rubric included some iframe type things like a Google map and Calendar. Generally they found this a little less fun and engaging than the favourite day. I picked this particular site for the completeness of the solution. This particular student has very high standards.

This was a class project. 1 person that worked on this project was a high school english teacher with a masters in language and experience from South Korea. Another one of the students was a film student. Both of these students had their sights set on D2l/Brightspace. Both of them are working there today. A third student, the author of the particular game in the screenshot, had a psychology degree. He went on to help hire students from following cohorts.

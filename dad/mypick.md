Grant Birks and I wanted to take our buddy Bovas (on the right) for his first canoe trip. I asked Dad to go along as a 4th. We went to McRae lake, and I forgot about the little portage at the start. Grant and I carried the stuff while Dad and Bovas sat and enjoyed the perfect late August or early September weather.
